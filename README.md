# RenTON  

## Kherson Underground team's submission for Telegram Hack-a-TON #1

Bicycle/e-scooter rental prototype that processes transactions in TON TestNet blockchain.

### A couple of notes:
  - Working Payment Channel service is [here](https://github.com/devils2ndself/kherson-underground/tree/main/chariton-api/services)
  - The two wallets' addresses that we are using are `EQDGi47qkbNPyUCctuhzkbNfVfTCvWf-2CvNUbEpfB6ru9Up` (user) and `EQAKU7BeY8nGhFvYWjbVuFUEXAGweQEroUzENxSQjyBtVEgH` (system)
  - Putting app + api to hosting had it's own challenges of maximum transactions limits, but works great in local environment
  - ChariTON was our previous idea and we couldn't rename the main folders at that stage
